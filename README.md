# Space Frog

Space Frog is a Pygame game created as the final project for CPSC 4970: Python.  You are a frog in a space suit who is trying to make your way across an asteroid field to reach the exit jump gate. How to play:
* Use the arrow keys to control your jetpack rockets.  Be careful.  This uses fuel and you can run out.
* Go slow to land on asteroids. Go faster to bounce off of them.  Go too fast and this will be fatal.
* Pay attention to the display in the upper left corner.  This will tell you your speed, how much fuel you have left, and how close you are to the exit.

## Installation

Space Frog requires Python 3 and Pygame 2.3.0 or higher.

* Clone the repository.
* Use requirements.txt to install the requirements or just install Pygame using your preferred method.
* Run space_frog/space_frog_game.py to start the game.
